To pass data from child component to parent
1. declare an output
2. @Output() onHide = new EventEmitter<boolean>(); create new instance of evenemitter 
3. emit the value from any event 
	  hideClick() {
    this.onHide.emit(true);
    this.isVisible = false;
  }
4. capture event on parent 
	(onHide)="toggleVisible($event)"
where toggleVisible is another function in parent component, which get the value from
this.onHide.emit(true)


To pass data to child component
1. declare a variable with @Input() decorator
2. Once you add this decorator, the variable can get the value from outside
3. Pass the required parameter from parent use "[input_property]="varfromparent""  to pass data
